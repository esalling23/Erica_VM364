#ReBirth 
##A game about habitat sustainability and diversity

####The player will dive into a virtual representation of different natural habitats on earth, prior to their destruction due to a number of different reasons, though mostly via human action. Taking on the role of a robot built by the humans to survive in the wasteland that is the Earth long left behind, the player will be thrust into tiny-worlds of these environments and be tasked with rehabilitating them to their former glory. 
####The game attempts to use educational research as a basis for learning and understanding how our current and slowly depleting environments work and function as a whole, and how human actions can affect their growth. There is a deep focus on building diversity and using sustainable practices as game mechanisms.
