#PacMan vs Ghost

#####First Attempts
Our task was simple: find a way to "hack" the classic game, PacMan. To start this process, we first had to create the environment of PacMan as a paper-prototype. Taking the classic checkers board, we used tape to fashion a left-right symetrical maze; we used four colored paper-clips for ghosts, and a red thing for PacMan.

We soon realized that it would be harder than we thought to prototype having four ghosts, especially since each had a different "trait" that determined how it moved:

* Green = Follows Green Path
* Blue = Can Jump Over 1 Square of Nothing (Wall)
* Red = Double Speed (Moves)
* White = Rotates Board Once Every 6 Turns

Everything was based on the  fruits, and which fruit "triggered" it's corresponding colored ghost to start eating the remaining fruit. Since the fruits were PacMan's goal, he would obviously try to stop the ghost before all fruits are eaten, and once caught any eaten fruits would be replaced where they were. This was a fun idea, but got difficult once there were five hands moving around the board, especially since the movement was controlled by dice. 

To change the pace of the game, the dice were removed and replaced by single-space movement and a turn-based system instead of everyone moving at the same time. We also got a new board to test out our new changes.
