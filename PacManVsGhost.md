#####First Attempts
Our task was simple: find a way to "hack" the classic game, PacMan. To start this process, we first had to create the environment of PacMan as a paper-prototype. Taking the classic checkers board, we used tape to fashion a left-right symetrical maze; we used four colored paper-clips for ghosts, and a red thing for PacMan.

We soon realized that it would be harder than we thought to prototype having four ghosts, especially since each had a different "trait" that determined how it moved, its motives, etc. Everything was based on the fruits, and which fruit "triggered" it's corresponding colored ghost to start eating the remaining fruit. Since the fruits were PacMan's goal, he would obviously try to stop the ghost before all fruits are eaten, and once caught any eaten fruits would be replaced where they were.
